<h2><a name="top"></a>Managing Domains on the Platform</h2>
<p>The domain is an entity used to model integration to an external identity store, such as Facebook, Google, or Siteminder. For example, if a tenant wants the tenant platform to be set up so that users can log in using accounts from an external identity store such as Siteminder, we model the domain in our database.</p>
<p>Domains can be configured for multiple purposes. For example, one domain one could be for logging in to the portal, a second could be for OAuth resource owners, and a third could be for sending API requests.</p>
<p>One domain can be configured for use for multiple purposes, or separate domains can be configured for separate purposes. As a hypothetical scenario, one tenant could have two domains&#8212;one for general use, allowing developers to log in via Facebook, and the other for Site Administrators or Business Administrators, allowing login only by signing up for the platform. This scenario would provide a &quot;back door&quot; in case an issue were to arise with the first domain, and can also offer streamlined access to advanced features for the administrators.</p>
<p>When a particular domain is configured for the purpose of developer logins to the portal, it is called a <strong>login domain</strong>.</p>
<p>In the <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/_PlatformName.lbi" -->Enterprise API Platform<!-- #EndLibraryItem --> user interface, in the Administration section, the Administrator can set up domains and then specify which domains are used for login and for other purposes. In the user interface, domain configuration is done by the Site Administrator.</p>
<p>In the API, activities relating to domains are supported by several operations, including an operation in the <a href="index_login.htm">Login</a> service that retrieves a list of available domains and an operation in the <a href="index_users.htm">Users</a> service that returns the login domain for a specified user.</p>
