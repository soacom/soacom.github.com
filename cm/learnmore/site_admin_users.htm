<a name="who_can_manage_user_accounts"></a><h3>Who can manage user accounts?</h3>
<p>Only Site Administrators can access the <em>Administration &gt; Users</em> page and manage user accounts.</p>
<p>Only a Site Administrator for Policy Manager can configure the user roles setting, which denies access to users with certain roles.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="how_do_i_manage_user_accounts_in_the_platform"></a><h3>How do I manage user accounts in the platform?</h3>
<p>There are two ways to manage platform access:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Exclude specific roles from access</strong>: this is controlled by a setting in Policy Manager and requires installation of an add-on, <strong>SOA Software Scheduled Jobs</strong>. For more information, see <a href="#how_do_i_exclude_roles">How do I exclude specific roles from platform access?</a></li>
  <li><strong>Manage individual user accounts</strong>: the Site Admin can manage user accounts on the platform via <em>Administration&nbsp;&gt; Users</em>, on the List of Users page. This page provides a summary listing of user account details, statistics about each user's activity on the platform, and actions that a Site Admin can take on a user account. See <a href="#what_actions_can_i_perform_on_user_accounts">What actions can I perform on user accounts?</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>



<a name="what_actions_can_i_perform_on_user_accounts"></a><h3>What actions can I perform on user accounts?</h3>
<p>The Site Admin can perform the following actions on user accounts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Activate: see <a href="#how_do_i_activate_a_user_account">How do I activate a user account?</a></li>
  <li>Disable: see <a href="#how_do_i_disable_a_user_account">How do I disable a user account?</a></li>
  <li>Enable: see <a href="#how_do_i_enable_a_user_account">How do I enable a user account that's been disabled?</a></li>
  <li>Delete: see <a href="#how_do_i_delete_a_user_account">How do I delete a user account?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Valid actions for a specific user account are determined by the account's current status, as shown in the table below.</p>
<table cellspacing="0px" class="doctable" style="width: 90%;">
