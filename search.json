Once app registered, it's important set authentication app use API process messages securely. SOA Software Open, part setting app, you’ll need choose security mechanism you’ll use authentication messages. two choices: Note: topic provides information setting authentication any API hosted SOA Software Open. implementation information examples specific API you're using, refer documentation API. Both approaches very secure. Both use secret key combined hashing encoding, both sent via HTTPS. Shared Secret approach, default, easier implement since don't generate public private keys. PKI approach little more secure, although both approaches very secure. PKI approach more complex implement. Back top register app, AppID Shared Secret automatically generated. Shared Secret binary hashed value, generated secure environment SOA Software Open known SOA Software Open. Security Credentials section App Details screen you'll Shared Secret option default security mechanism. Shared Secret approach follows WS-Security digest authentication mechanism. Shared Secret, generated SOA Software Open, 40-character alphanumeric value acts key. example shown below. combine Shared Secret two values, hash result using SHA-1 secure hashing algorithm, encode hashed value using Base64 encoding scheme. URL-encode result, isn't required. result sent Authorization message header value atmosphere_secret_digest parameter. API verifies each incoming request using Shared Secret. choose Shared Secret security mechanism, Authorization header must include values shown below. More information shared secret approach given sections: process flow diagram below shows overview API request authentication shared secret security mechanism. Below example Authorization header app authentication parameters, use shared secret approach. sequence parameters isn't significant, parameters must present valid values. Note: value realm determined www-Authenticate header. Make sure value set Authorization: SOA Software Open header matches value received attribute server. nonce random string uniquely generated each request. nonce allows API providers verify request never made before. nonce sent message header both Shared Secret PKI security mechanisms. Shared Secret mechanism, same nonce value sent message header used creating Secret Digest. way create nonce depend development environment. Most programming languages include method creating nonce. Below example generating nonce value Java: timestamp request sent message header, both Shared Secret PKI security mechanisms. Shared Secret mechanism used creating Secret Digest. timestamp must Unix epoch time, expressed number milliseconds since January GMT. timestamp must positive integer must greater equal timestamp used previous requests. most implementations, timestamp taken host server. It's important timestamp message accurate; timestamp message might rejected. more information Unix epoch time, examples implementation timestamp different programming languages, http://www.epochconverter.com (scroll down). SHA-1 cryptographic hash function, broadly used trusted. hash value SHA-1, hash function returns 160-bit string. message digest. value hashed sent message; receipt point, value hashed again, two hash values compared. two hash values match, secure, reliable indication message hasn't changed; message receipt point accurate duplication message send point. you're using Shared Secret security mechanism, concatenate nonce, timestamp, Shared Secret, hash combined value using SHA-1. encode result, send message header value atmosphere_secret_digest parameter. formula computing hash Below example hashed base string: concatenate nonce, timestamp, app secret base string hashed, you'll need make sure concatenated value byte value before hashing. hashing algorithm requires input parameter bytes. Depending app, might need use encoding byte value. use UTF-8 encoding. Below example using Java. Note: example above part larger Java sample specific API. more information, refer implementation examples API you're using. Base64 encoding scheme converts binary data ASCII string. you're using Shared Secret security mechanism, must encode binary hash value created using SHA-1 secure hash algorithm. Encoding turns ASCII string format. It's common practice encode data make sure remains intact without modification during transport HTTPS. Once hash encoded, next step send encoded value message header value atmosphere_secret_digest parameter. there's problem HTTPS header, might error messages shown below. any reason know suspect app's Shared Secret might compromised, must generate new Shared Secret replace old generate new Shared Secret Community Platform Note: might take five minutes new key take effect. During time, messages sent using new key fail. It's best wait five minutes before sending messages new key. Below example create atmosphere_secret_digest value Java.

Important: Upload file csr.csr SOA Software Open portal. Java developer worked cryptography Java, might familiar concept keystore. keystore file used store deploy certificates private keys single package. create keystore using OpenSSL explained above. However, Java developer, probably far more convenient use keytool, key certificate management utility that's distributed part Java Development Kit (JDK). use keytool create both keystore CSR associated private key keystore. Once you've created CSR, upload SOA Software Open just any CSR. Java code reads private key, used signing base string used API request headers, keystore file create. Since keytool utility part JDK, don't download anything create Java keystore. Just follow steps below.

Note: implementation examples, check authentication documentation specific API you're using. IMPORTANT Upload file CSR.csr SOA Software Open portal. signature process follows similar approach OAuth standard. platform uses Extension header support its app authentication scheme. Extension header named Atmosphere (not case-sensitive). uses standard Authorization header WWW-Authenticate response header pass app-related authentication parameters. query string used pass authentication data cases app cannot directly manipulate headers. API providers indicate support extension returning SOA Software Open WWW-Authenticate header response app requests protected resources. Below example: Apps send credentials Authorization header. choose Public Key Integration approach app security, Authorization header must include values shown below. Important: sequence header attributes critical must exactly match order below. Below example Authorization header app authentication parameters. Make sure list parameters sequence shown below. Note: value realm determined www-Authenticate header. Make sure value set Authorization: SOA Software Open header matches value received attribute server. Below example Authorization header API doesn't require authentication: Note: case client, such Ajax client browser Android app, cannot set Authorization header, set required SOA Software Open authorization header parameters query string. several steps composing signature: first step composing digital signature create content.

Back top great flexibility feature gives very fine control API offering. Below hypothetical implementation scenarios showing use feature package API: new operations assigned scope, specifically large customer, visibility setting Private. operations assigned second scope visibility Public. Two licenses defined. large customer, offers access both scopes; second, customers, offers access public scope. Both licenses offer same quality service. API Admin creates Private API Group invites large customer. customers, not being invited private group, unaware new operations. documentation tagged visibility tags each license, portion API documentation that’s visible specific app developer matches developer’s visibility API defined Business Admin defines single scope, since access granted operations. defines three licenses—Bronze, Silver, Gold; each License Term includes scope applicable QoS policy tier. API uses licenses. Privacy not factor; fact, customers need able offerings choose, therefore scopes licenses visibility setting Public. Business Admin defines two scopes, Credit credit card transactions Debit debit cards. two QoS policies, smaller customers larger customers, resulting four separate license offerings; debit card processing Silver Gold QoS levels credit card processing Silver Gold QoS levels. scenario, Business Admin sets four licenses visible customers. API Admin assigns Credit scope operations relating credit cards, Debit scope operations debit card transactions. Since licenses offered marked publicly visible, developer requesting API access sees four options. developer chooses license most applicable type transactions app processes level service required. offer two categories API access; unlimited read-only access operations), unlimited write access operations part Business Admin first defines applicable scopes, maps scopes licenses. Later, scopes mapped applicable operations below). Business Admin: API Admin assigns operations Read scope assigns remaining operations Update scope.

Typically, Business Admin might responsible multiple APIs. platform, Business Admin same rights API Admin each API business, additional rights. Business Admin defines key components Licenses feature including Scopes, License Terms, Licenses. Once defined, available use any API business. each API, API Admin implements feature assigning operations scopes, manages visibility assigning licenses groups. more information Scopes, License Terms, Licenses, Components below. API Admin responsible API definition platform. API setup, chooses use Licenses feature assigns scopes operations. API Admin determines visibility API.

API Admins responsible tagging API documentation visibility tags, uploading API documentation, approving access requests developers apps. Note: Depending platform set individual users might not permission create modify API unless user Business Admin. main platform user, app developer, reaps benefits feature smooth user experience. making API access request, app developer chooses selection more licenses applicable API. app developer, it’s simply matter choosing, licenses offered API, most closely offers capabilities quality service looking Licenses feature uses following components: Scopes, Terms, QoS Policies, Legal Agreements make hierarchy License definition. Visibility, API access requests, API documentation tags not specifically part hierarchy key components. scope entity define represent any subdivision API might separate control separate control specific operation, define scope includes operation. separate control READ operations, create scope those. guiding principle defining scopes level granularity that’s needed defining API offered app developers. scope bridge between top level hierarchy, license, bottom level, API operation (method). Business Admin defines basic scope definition. API level, API Admin assigns specific operations more scopes API. operations included any license scope assigned specific API. example, Business Admin might define scopes based roles groups identity management system, since scopes way define authorization policies become linked user’s token after authentication. API Admin links scopes specific functionality API assigning scopes operations. operation assigned multiple scopes, app developer sees operation developer visibility applicable scopes. Similarly, app that’s accessing API must applicable scopes its license not able access operation. Scopes arranged hierarchy; top-level scope child scope, child itself child scope. scope hierarchy used, user visibility parent scope automatically visibility descendent scopes. Similarly, app parent Scope1 part access scope API, scopes descendants Scope1 automatically considered part App’s access scope. Looking permissions another perspective, app, user, group access descendent scope, assumed app, user, group access parent scope, top scope level. example scope implementation—the Business Admin might create two scopes, Read Update. defining logical groupings, Business Admin enables API Admin assign applicable operations those two scopes, thus package API license offerings. scope definition includes scope name, short long descriptions, visibility setting. supports additional settings any operations assigned scope: whether anonymous access allowed production and/or sandbox environments, whether anonymous access allowed production and/or sandbox environments, whether scope offered default OAuth grant. not using OAuth just ignore settings relating OAuth. Note: future, scope definitions apply OAuth Licenses. Currently, OAuth scopes License scopes maintained separately. license term custom grouping scopes QoS policies. essentially same thing term business contract. case, term defines access being offered (scope) level access (QoS policy). any impact, license term must include least scope. license include more license term. It’s important understand QoS policies apply license term, not individual scopes term. Let’s say example term includes: scenario, either scope process transactions per second long combined total number transactions operations both scopes does not exceed per second. QoS policies core part API definition, add another dimension Licenses feature beyond restricting visibility/access, allowing apply use-based policies licenses. QoS policies defined SOA Software Policy Manager System Admin. specific choice QoS policy, additional policy configuration steps, include such options steps take access exceeds SLA agreement. Once defined Policy Manager, available platform selection defining license term. Once defined Policy Manager, available platform selection defining license term. allows different QoS policies offered app developers. making API access request, app developer choose license includes QoS SLA needs app, request access level. QoS SLA enforced based each app-to-API service contract. license constructed follows: Business Admin define more legal agreements upload platform. Once available platform, more legal agreements incorporated license definition. Once legal agreement defined part license, API Access wizard displays agreement any developer requesting API access license. developer must accept legal agreement part API access request. license top-level item customization dovetails clear specific offering app developer. license model defined Business Admin. API Admin completes picture, relating license API, assigning scopes specific operations. app developer requests API access, licensing choices presented part API Access wizard app developer simply selects license most suitable unique scenario app. points licenses: two core visibility states objects platform—Public, means object visible anyone accesses platform, Private, means visible invited users (members invited group). API, Scope, License, App, Group Public Private visibility options. Public Private visibility states work Licenses feature allow very fine control visibility offer API. API private, control visibility inviting groups users API. private licenses, determine licenses offered groups.

Gold customers Silver customers not Gold content. point app developer requests access API both app developer customers reap benefits Licenses feature. Instead black white all-or-none access, app developer choose licenses defined API designated visible him/her, choose license most applicable app’s exact scenario—the operations app needs access appropriate level access (quality service). API includes subsets (scopes, packaged licenses) select audience, developers never those options associated documentation. Each developer available him/her, those choices request API access most appropriate license. final step process, licenses set API access requests require manual approval API admin, evaluating API access request API admin further modify API access level granted app. Briefly, high-level steps implement feature.

Any functions defined json2 used Script Activity source code. following pre-defined variables provided. more information refer Scripts API located \\sm70\\docs\\scriptDocs folder Policy Manager release folder. Click index.htm launch documentation: following script creates normalized copy message saves variable. line processContext used message variable named “message”. line normalized copy made message. Finally line processContext used save normalized copy variable named “copy” used activities execute after process. next script illustrates use msgFactory create normalized message. normalized message contains XML element referenced wsdl:Message element WSDL document. line msgFactory used create normalized message named temp. line content line set temp message content. line processContext used save new message variable named temp. Message creation not limited normalized messages. Protocol specific messages any content-type constructed using msgFactory. following example shows creation JSON message. Note line call msgFactory create message different, both function name need specifying content-type message, application/json case. Back top Branch Activity provides mechanism alternate process flows, branches, based boolean conditions. Drop Branch Activity Process page connect last activity executed before branch Branch Activity. Figure. Adding Branch Activity Branch Activity itself very little configuration. branch conditions themselves most information. double click Branch Activity list conditions most importantly establish expression language each branch condition use. branch conditions must use same language. supported languages XPath, JavaScript, Jython, BeanShell.
